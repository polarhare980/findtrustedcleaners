# How to Hire a Cleaner in the UK
Hiring a cleaner shouldn’t be stressful. Here’s a fast, practical approach:
1. **Decide your scope** — weekly standard clean, deep clean, end of tenancy, etc.
2. **Check availability** — choose slots that match your schedule.
3. **Verify reviews** — look for recent ratings and consistent feedback.
4. **Confirm the span** — make sure your chosen service duration matches the cleaner’s minimum time.
5. **Use secure payments** — book through platforms with protected checkout and receipts.
> Tip: On FindTrustedCleaners, availability grids are unified across the site, so what you see on a profile is what you’ll get on checkout.
